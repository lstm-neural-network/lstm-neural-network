#Data

For this project we will be using the historical stock market data going back 5 years for two publicly traded companies, Apple - sticker AAPL & General Motors - sticker GM. We will mainly focus on AAPL as our subject data set as we test how accurately LSTMS can predict financial time series data. GM will be used to compare/contrast the results between the companies. The data is sourced using the yfinance package in python, yfinance is an open source tool that uses Yahoo's publicly available APIs to download market data. Below you will find the code snippet to download the data.

```{python}
#Downloading the Data

!pip install yfinance
import yfinance as yf
from datetime import datetime

#Stocks that we'll be analyzing
AAPL = ['AAPL']
GM = ['GM']

#Set start and end date for the data pull
#We want to look at the past 5 years, so we'll pull the previous 5 years of data
end_time = datetime.now()
start_time = datetime(end_time.year - 5, end_time.month, end_time.day)

#download the stocks we want to model into seperate dataframes
AAPL = yf.download(AAPL, start_time, end_time, actions=True)
GM = yf.download(GM, start_time, end_time)

#View the data
AAPL.head(10)

```

**2.1 Data Variables Description**

Several variables are retrieved for each stock. The definitions for the variables are as follows :

**Date** : This represents the date associated with each data point, such as daily stock prices.

**Open** : The stock price at the time of opening on a given trading day

**Close** : The stock price at the time of closing on a given trading day

**High** : The highest stock price reached on a given day.

**Low** : The lowest stock price reached on a given day.

**Dividends** : The amount of dividends paid to shareholders.

**Split ratio** : If there have been stock splits, this variable indicates the split ratio.

**Adj Close** : The closing stock price adjusted for any corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits.

**Volume** : The total number of shares traded on a given day.

**Market Capitalization** : The total market value of the market's shares.

In addition to the variables to the above variables, we are also going to add two more variables.

**PCT Change** - this calculates the percentage change of the closing price.

**Moving Average** - this variable will represent the average change of closing price for the series.
